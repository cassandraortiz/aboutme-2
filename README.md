# About Me

This page contains a short biography about myself, my education history, and proffesional experience, as well as some of my goals. It interacts with the user by asking  5, yes or no questions about me. Users must answer with yes or no or y or n. An alert will return a message telling the user if the answer was correct or not. 


# Deployment steps
I started by creating the aboutme repo in Github. Then I created all the files and directories in the terminal. I started adding HTML, CSS, and JS content utilizing what we have leaned in class so far. 

In the index.html file, I am using a \<p> element to display my short bio. 

In the style.css file I am styling the html content using different elements and attributes. 

In the apps.js file, I welcome the user with a prompt asking for their name. Then I ask 5 yes or not questions and retrnung a message letting them know if they answered correctly or not. 

I have been making constant changes to these files and I am following the Add, Commit, Push process to keep the latest version in github.
