# About Me

author: Chuck Li Villalobos

Description:
This page contains a short biography about myself, my education history, and proffesional experience, as well as some of my goals. It interacts with the user by asking them 5 yes or no questions about me, and see lets the user know how many correct answers they get. 

Today I started by creating the aboutme repo in Github. Then I created all the files and directories in the terminal. I started adding HTML, CSS, and JS content utilizing what we have leaned in class so far. 

In the index.html file, I am using a \<p> element to display my short bio. 

In the style.css file I am styling the html content using different elements and attributes. 

In the apps.js file, I welcome the user with a prompt asking for their name. Then I ask 5 yes or not questions and retrnung a message letting them know if they answered correctly or not.
